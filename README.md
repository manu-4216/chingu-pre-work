## Book Finder application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

- `npm start`
- `npm run build`

_Requirements:_
Create an application that allows you to use the Google Books API to search for books. You may need to signup with google to get a API key; read the documentation for more information.

This application should allow you to:

- Enter a query in a search box
- Display a list of books matching the given query.
- Each item in the list should include the book's author, title, and publishing company, as well as a picture of the book.
- From each list item, you should also be able to navigate to more information about the book, but this information does not necessarily need to appear on a page within your application. In other words, this could link out to an external site with more information about that particular book.
